The Exam is 2 hours (120 minutes) long. Bring a watch with you! 

The Exam contains 4 questions, you must answer 3.  

Each Question is worth 25 marks. (Exam is worth 70% so 1 mark ~ 1%) 

The maximum score you can receive in the paper is 75 marks.   

Those 75 marks are equivalent to 70% of the total grade for this module. 

Know how much percent you need before going into the exam: e.g. if I have 15 percent already. I need 25% to pass. That means I need 75/70*25 (i.e. 26.8) marks in the exam. 

When you get the exam paper, spend the first 10 minutes planning what questions you will answer to maximise your result. Carefully look at the marks for each part of each question. 

Set aside 10 minutes at the end of the exam to go back over your solutions. 

You have (120 - 10 - 10) / 75 = 1.33 minutes (i.e. 1 minute 20 seconds) for each mark. (e.g. spend no longer than 6 mins 40 seconds on a 5-mark question) 

The exam paper will follow previous years question style. Complete previous exam paper questions and study the notes. 

You will need to know how to write classes and methods on a blank piece of paper 

Do not scribble out work done. Put a light line through if you want but all will be corrected.  

Your aim is to maximise your marks. A lot of marks go for the initial attempt of the question and then a few extra for the hard bit at the end. If you can not complete a 10 mark question don’t give up. Do as much as you can. Draw out the class, constructor, getters, setters and other methods. 

Don’t spend 10 mins on a 4 mark question you have not notion about. Quickly give it your best guess and move on. 

Look at all questions as they may help with answers to other questions. 

You should know how define APIE and give a code example.
